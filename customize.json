From calling at midnight and waiting for us in the mrng at Fiesta, Gng to Buddist Monastery to Skidding our bike at Mandalpatti. From starting in the rain to escaping and reaching beach, taking pics at bridge, giving poses at beach. From accident to celebrating my birthday. I know I am not good at impressing or expressing but I like to have memories :) that is the main reason I came to Mumbai. I thought atleast 10 mins of seeing you should be fine :)",
